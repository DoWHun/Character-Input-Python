Character Input Excersice in Python

The input text is Hungarian.
The desc is english as I can recal.
Basicaly what the program does is asks for the users name and age.
After giving input it tells u how old u r and when u will turn a 100 yrs old.
Currently there are no limitations on user input I will fix that later.
Feel free to fork the code if u need it.
If you add limitations to it feel free to past it in or comment it.

These are excersices for beginner Python programmers.
